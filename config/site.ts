  {
    question: "What do you pay for my land?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The prices we pay are a win-win for both parties. We do not pay retail, however, that cost can be made up when you factor in the fact that we charge ZERO in commissions, plus we pick up all associated administrative and closing costs. In addition, we close very quickly because we are paying in cash. This saves you money by shortening the period of time in which you are responsible for taxes, assessments, and maintenance of the property. Remember, the land market is very slow, selling the traditional way, and using a realtor to find a buyer can take months if not longer. Costs incurred over this time can add up fast. Before binding yourself to a realtor, get our offer and run the numbers for yourself. There is zero obligation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there ANY hidden costs or fees?",
    answer: "Never. Not a dime. What we offer you is what you will take home",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes you different from a real estate agent?",
    answer:
      "We are direct buyers. We buy land that is not being used in an effort to help it see it’s greatest potential. Let’s say a lot is located in suburban. Our goal is to help property owners feel elated by their real estate decisions. If you do have a piece of land that is doing nothing for you, maybe we can help you with the cash to find something better suited for YOUR needs. Real estate agents list properties (often at inflated prices) in hopes that someone will buy them, and they will get their hefty commission. You will have to sign a contract, binding you to them for a certain amount of time. You will own them their commission no matter how the property is sold, even if you find the buyer yourself.",
  },
  {
    question: "If I Get An Offer, Is There an Obligation?",
    answer:
      "There is never any obligation or hassle. Once you tell us a little about your property we will then study the market and comparable properties. Within 48 hours we will have an offer for you. It is completely up to you if you decide to sell or not. There is no risk, obligation or hassle.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to show you the property?",
    answer:
      "No, you don’t have to come to the property for a showing. We do our research completely with online tools and local partners who know the land market very well.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you buy any type of property?",
    answer:
      "We buy a lot of property types, but we have buying criteria for every region. We suggest you to request a free offer online and we’ll tell you if we can buy your property.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the steps to sell my land to Sundial Lands?",
    answer:
      "It’s pretty easy actually. First you need to start the process by requesting an offer through the online form or by calling us at 4086502863. Then we will research your property and send you an offer price. Then the decision is yours, accept the offer or not.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does selling to Sundial Lands cost?",
    answer:
      "Our service is 100% free. This means you don’t have to pay for anything out of your pocket. No listing fees, no commisions, no processing costs. We will never ask of any money from you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you a real estate company or a realtor?",
    answer:
      "Our service is 100% free. This means you don’t have to pay for anything out of your pocket. No listing fees, no commisions, no processing costs. We will never ask of any money from you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you a real estate company or a realtor?",
    answer:
      "We are a real estate investment company. Meaning that we buy the properties with our own money directly from you. Using our own funds, we can buy your property much more quickly than would be the case if you were to sell it through a real estate agent.",
